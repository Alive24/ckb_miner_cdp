# Collective Mining (M1)

<Callout emoji="👾">
### Milestone 1 Preview
- Milestone 1 allows only CKB as collaterals at this stage which means that ICR won't fluctuate against price volatility and solvency is guaranteed in this case;
- Estimated to take around 4 months.

- Milestone 1.1: Mining Schedules
- Milestone 1.2: Redemption
- Milestone 1.3: Treasury and Interests
- Milestone 1.4: Collateral Ratio and Liquidation
</Callout>



## Overview

In CoMine, collective mining for CKB means that it:

1. Tokenise mining into offering and recruiting;
2. Split mining rewards into sponsoring and redeeming thus anonymous/collective ;
3. Allow early settlement before actual rewards for liquidity and speculation;
4. Promise solvency and yield protocol revenue with liquidation and redemption by treasury;



### Mining Schedules: Mining Offering / Mining Recruiting

Mining schedules enable two-way tokenization of mining through **Mining Offering** and **Mining Recruiting**:

- **Mining Offering**: Miners register with collaterals and propose offerings at their own price and volume. Sponsors accept and pay immediately, receiving mCKB tokens while the provider receives payment and incurs debt (1:1 CKB to mCKB).

- **Mining Recruiting**: Sponsors propose recruiting opportunities with funding. Providers accept and receive funding immediately, while sponsors receive mCKB tokens and the provider incurs debt.

Both mechanisms require miners to maintain a healthy Individual Collateral Ratio (ICR) to avoid liquidation. 

See [Mining Schedule](./Mechanisms/Mining%20Schedule) for detailed information.

### Redemption

Holders of mCKB tokens can redeem them for CKB at a 1:1 ratio from the protocol pool. Redemption takes 30 days by default without additional fee while quicker options (instant, 1 day, 7 days, 14 days) with varying fee rates are also available.

See [Redemption](./Mechanisms/Redemption) for detailed information.

### Collateral Ratio Management and Liquidation

Collateral Ratio is the ratio of collateral values over debt values.

Miners must maintain a healthy **Individual Collateral Ratio (ICR)** by adding collaterals or repaying debt. Providers can repay using mCKB or CKB or directly mine to the protocol. When ICR falls below the **Critical Collateralization Ratio (CCR)**, miners enter **Recovery Mode**, where actions lowering ICR are blocked and daily **Soft Liquidation** occurs. If ICR continues to fall below the **Minimum Collateralization Ratio (MCR)**, **Hard Liquidation** occurs, transferring all collaterals and liquidation reserve to the treasury. When **Total Collateral Ratio (TCR)** falls below CCR, the whole protocol enters **Global Recovery Mode**.

See [Collateral Ratio](./Mechanisms/Collateral%20Ratio) and [Liquidation](./Mechanisms/Liquidation) for detailed information.

### Treasury

The Treasury is a public protocol actor that mitigates solvency risks and yields protocol revenue to build an independent, self-sustainable DAO. It receives liquidated collaterals and repayments to serve redemptions. The Treasury automatically arbitrages when mCKB depegs from CKB. 

See [Treasury](./Protocol%20Roles/Treasury) for detailed information.
