# Collective Mining (M1)

<Callout emoji="👾">
### Milestone 1 Preview
- Milestone 1 allows only CKB as collaterals at this stage which means that ICR won't fluctuate against price volatility and solvency is guaranteed in this case;
- Estimated to take around 4 months.

- Milestone 1.1: Mining Schedules
- Milestone 1.2: Redemption
- Milestone 1.3: Treasury and Interests
- Milestone 1.4: Collateral Ratio and Liquidation
</Callout>



## Overview

With CoMine, we transformed mining to be:
- **Collective**: Miners and Sponsors only interact with the protocol and do not need to know each other;
- **Anonymous & Tokenized**: Sponsors mint tradeable and fungible tokens (mCKB) against miners' debt 1:1 and redeem for target assets (CKB) 1:1;
- **Collateralized**: Redemption is backed by the whole protocol collectively instead of the actual miner;
- **Financialised**: Miners are able to fine control risk and exposure, speculate, leverage, and liquidity;
- **Incentivised**: By adjusting fee rates and issuing $COMINE, the protocol can incentivise miners with specific attributes (e.g. smaller size, different locations, different mining machines) to increase miner decentralisation.

## Mechanisms

### Mining Schedules: Mining Offering / Mining Recruiting

Mining schedules enable two-way tokenization of mining through **Mining Offering** and **Mining Recruiting**:

- **Mining Offering**: Miners register with collaterals deposits and propose offerings at their own price and volume. Sponsors accept and pay immediately, receiving mCKB tokens while the miner receives payment and incurs debt (1:1 CKB to mCKB) to the miner.

- **Mining Recruiting**: Sponsors propose recruiting with funding. Miners accept and receive funding immediately, while sponsors receive mCKB tokens and the miner incurs debt.

Both mechanisms require miners to maintain a healthy Individual Collateral Ratio (ICR) to avoid liquidation. 

See [Mining Schedule](./Mechanisms/Mining%20Schedule) for detailed information.

### Redemption

Holders of mCKB tokens can redeem them for CKB at a 1:1 ratio from the protocol pool. Redemption takes 30 days by default without additional fee while quicker options (instant, 1 day, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days) with varying fee rates are also available.

See [Redemption](./Mechanisms/Redemption) for detailed information.

### Collateral Ratio Management and Liquidation

Collateral Ratio is the ratio of collateral values over debt values.

Miners must maintain a healthy **Individual Collateral Ratio (ICR)** by adding collaterals or repaying debt. Providers can repay using mCKB or CKB or directly mine to the protocol. When ICR falls below the **Critical Collateralization Ratio (CCR)**, miners enter **Recovery Mode**, where actions lowering ICR are blocked and daily **Soft Liquidation** occurs. If ICR continues to fall below the **Minimum Collateralization Ratio (MCR)**, **Hard Liquidation** occurs, transferring all collaterals and liquidation reserve to the treasury. When **Total Collateral Ratio (TCR)** falls below CCR, the whole protocol enters **Global Recovery Mode**.

See [Collateral Ratio](./Mechanisms/Collateral%20Ratio) and [Liquidation](./Mechanisms/Liquidation) for detailed information.

### Treasury

The Treasury is a public protocol actor that mitigates solvency risks and yields protocol revenue to build an independent, self-sustainable DAO. It receives liquidated collaterals and repayments to serve redemptions. The Treasury automatically arbitrages when mCKB depegs from CKB. 

See [Treasury](./Protocol%20Roles/Treasury) for detailed information.
