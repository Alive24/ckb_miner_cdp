# Sponsor

- Incentives:
  - Participate in mining without overhead
  - Speculation (Want to buy more before it rises)
  - Safe and rewarding strategy for HODL
- Example: Suppose a mining provider can mine 1 CKB at the cost of 0.8 CKB worth of USD at the moment and the price of CKB now is 0.01 USD.
  - This MS can propose mining recruiting at the price of 0.99 CKB: Consistently earn 1% CKB per month if there’s enough mining provider;
  - If this MS speculates the price of CKB to rise, this MP can propose mining recruiting at 0.9 CKB worth of USD, and later cell CKB at a higher price;
  - If this MS doesn’t want to take risk of holding CKB and just want to earn difference in mining and market, this MS can propose mining recruiting at 0.009 USD consistently and sell it at market price if there’s enough mining provider;
