## mCKB: Mining Contract Token

mCKB is the mining contract token that represents the dynamic and tokenized agreements between miners and sponsors: Miners receive immediate payment by minting mCKB against their debt, and sponsors receive mCKB and redeem for CKB 1:1 later as a way to engage in tokenised mining.

- **Against Debt**: Sponsors can mint mCKB against miner debt 1:1 at the miner’s price; 
- **Pegged to CKB**: mCKB is pegged to and redeemable for CKB 1:1;
- **Tradeable**: mCKB itself is tradeable on secondary markets;
- **Over-collateralisation**: mCKB is constantly over-collateralised which means that there will always be enough collateral in the protocol to redeem with mCKB;
