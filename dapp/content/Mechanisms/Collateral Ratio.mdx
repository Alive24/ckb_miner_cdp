# Collateral Ratio

- At any time, mining providers are obliged to maintain a healthy ICR or the collaterals will be liquidated; to do so, mining providers can stake more collaterals or repay debts; you can use mCKB or CKB to repay at 1% fee or directly mine to the protocol. By mining directly to repay or collateral, you enjoy a 0% fee.
- Recovery Mode
  - Mining Provider in Recovery Mode: When ICR < CCR, the mining provider will be put into recovery mode;
  - Global Recovery Mode: `Total Collateralization Ratio` may fall below `Critical Collateralization Ratio`. When TCR < CCR, the protocol will enter global recovery mode;
  - In recovery mode, actions that would lower ICR (For single mining provider in recovery mode) / TCR (For global recovery mode) will be blocked;
  - Would be redeemee before treasury.
