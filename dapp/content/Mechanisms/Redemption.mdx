# Redemption

- Holders of mining contract tokens can redeem them for the CKB 1:1 for the collaterals in the protocol pool;
- Redemption can take different time length (instant, 1 day, 7 days, 14 days, 28 days) at different fee rate
  - Redeem to iCKB by default; extra waiting time might apply for CKB.
- Redemption targets are selected based on their ICR;
  - (Milestone 2): Mining providers can set an additional interest rate to move further back in the redemption queue.
