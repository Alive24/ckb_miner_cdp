## Liquity V2

```markdown
- Multi-collateral support
  - Users can now also borrow against staked ETH from Lido (wstETH) and Rocket Pool (rETH).
- User-set interest rates
  - Liquity V2 users control their borrowing costs. Fix your interest rate and adjust it at any time.
- Liquity redemption risk
  - Better Control
  - Manage the redemption risk with your interest rate.
```

## Interests/Fee

- Yield interests/fee to Stability Pool;
- Yield interests/fee to DAO;

## Partial Liquidation

- Introduce partial liquidation bands, especially above CCR:
  - Soft liquidation (interest increase, forced repayment)
  - Hard liquidation only below a deeper threshold
- Non-linear interest rate: Higher ICR lower fee;

## User-set interest rates

- Steps
- Show redemption queue:
  - Percentile in all Mining Providers;
  - Volume behind;

## Improve clarity

- Target assets
- Stability Pool
- Mining Contract Token (e.g., mCKB)
- Deposit (Recruiter) vs. Stake (Provider)

## Recursive Mining Recruiting

- Buy mCKB, exchange it to CKB, and buy more mCKB;

## Governance

- Vote with protocol token

## Sparse

1. Convert liquidated collaterals to iCKB wisely (e.g Periodic Auction? Connect to UTXOSwap dynamically?);
2. Incentivize new and small mining providers by waiving fees or protocol token.

## Challenges and Edge Case

- CKB volatility
  - Soar: As debts are in CKB, ICR might rise significantly if not using CKB as collateral. Need to illustrate.
  - Crash
