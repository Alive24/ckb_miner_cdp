# CKB Miner CDP

Combine CKB Mining and Collateral Debt Position (CDP) to create a new type of DeFi/DePin protocol.

## Premise

- No premium for mining with solo pool
- Incentivize mining with financial services protocol;
  - Presale
    - Leverage
    - Liquidity
    - Speculation
  - Tokenized Mining
    - Mining as a Service
- iCKB and Collateral as Deposit

## Scenario 1: Presale

- Deposit collaterals/iCKB as deposit;
- Issue mCKB as presale for mining: Liquidity/Speculation in exchange for Discounted CKB;
- If ICR is lower than 150%, liquidate the position as a safeguard;

## Scenario 2: Coordinated Mining

- Lower premium for miner with higher ICR;
- Lower premium for mining with longer settlement period;

## Scenario 3: Tokenized Mining

- Use mCKB to buy fractionalized mining power: Easier upscale/downscale mining power and minimum share of fixed cost;
- Not just CKB but any form of mining. Decentralized.
